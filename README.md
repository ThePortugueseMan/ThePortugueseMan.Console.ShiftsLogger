## Challenges
- REST APIs
  - Quite rewarding to create a functional API and reading/learning more on the subject
  - I had to learn from scratch which was challenging, but in the end it all worked out!
  - Using swagger was very helpful, and I believe it will come in handy again

- Entity Framework
  - The scope of this project wasn't big enough to learn deeply about entity framework, but it was a solid introduction
  
## Areas to improve
- There's so much more to learn about REST APIs, I need to do more projects with them to become more proficient
- Same applies to Entity Framework
